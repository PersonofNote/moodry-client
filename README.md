# Moodry

## About

### The story
My mother requested a data-oriented mood tracker. She wants to be able to enter a value from [bad, neutral, good] as well as an optional note, and to be able to see this data visualized in a variety of ways. The goal is to identify trends and be able to predict and prepare for bad times, as well as to take advantage of good times!

This project is currently in active development.
